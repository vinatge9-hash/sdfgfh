Key design notes
- Cozy and warm aesthetic tailored for a coffee shop experience.
- Tailwind CSS is used via CDN (no separate CSS files).
- All HTML uses semantic elements (header, nav, main, section, article, footer).
- 1x h1 per page; h2 for section headings; proper alt text for images.
- Interactive elements (links, buttons) use smooth transitions.
- A lightweight mobile navigation with a playful hamburger toggle.
- Image placeholders use the format src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1635029783698-5152fbd342ba?crop=entropy&cs=tinysrgb&fit=max&fm=jpg&ixid=M3w3ODkyNDZ8MHwxfHNlYXJjaHw5fHxkZXNjcmlwdGlvbnxlbnwwfDB8fHwxNzU4NDY0NDE1fDA&ixlib=rb-4.1.0&q=80&w=1080".
- Footer shows 2025 as the copyright year and Hyderabad, India as the location.
